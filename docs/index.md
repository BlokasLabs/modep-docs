![modep-intro](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/BlokasLabs/pisound-docs/images/modep-intro.PNG)

MODEP is a virtual audio plugin pedalboard that lets you play around with hundreds of LV2 audio plugins ranging from a simple reverb to a complex FM synth using your Raspberry Pi and any Raspberry Pi sound card. Using an intuitive drag-and-drop web-based interface you can assemble your pedalboards as you do in real life. To add, MODEP is built using the MOD-UI and MOD-HOST open-source projects developed by the [MOD team](https://mod.audio), so if you like MODEP you should consider supporting them!
