- Connect to it via “**MODEP”** Wi-Fi hotspot using your computer or tablet (**psw:blokaslabs**).
- Open your computer’s or tablet’s browser and go to this address [http://172.24.1.1](http://172.24.1.1/) (you should see a similar view to the image above).
- That’s it. Now you can start building your pedalboards.
